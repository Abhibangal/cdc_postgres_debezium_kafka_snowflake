Running the CDC Pipeline

Start the containers
Run the following command in your terminal to spin up all services using Docker Compose:

docker compose up -d


Verify connector registration
After the containers are running, check the register-connector service to confirm that the connections for Postgres and Snowflake are established.

Validate data flow

Monitor Snowflake logs to ensure data is being ingested.

After approximately 15 minutes, verify that data has propagated to the SCD2 table.
